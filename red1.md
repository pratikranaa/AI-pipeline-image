**AI Frontend with Flask Backend Documentation**

This documentation provides instructions on setting up and running an AI frontend application with a Flask backend. The application utilizes React for the frontend, Flask for the backend, and Docker for containerization. The application allows users to upload images, perform image processing tasks such as object detection, classification, and image captioning, and view the processed images with annotations.

### 1. Introduction

This application provides a web interface for performing various image processing tasks such as object detection, classification, and captioning. It consists of a React frontend that interacts with a Flask backend to handle image processing tasks. The frontend communicates with the backend via HTTP requests.

### 2. Setup and Installation

#### Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- Python 3.x
- Docker (optional, for containerization)

#### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd ai-frontend
   ```
3. Install frontend dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Install backend dependencies (recommended to set up a virtual environment first):

   ```bash
   cd backend
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # For Unix/Mac
   env\Scripts\activate  # For Windows
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### 3. Running the Application

#### Development Mode

To run the application in development mode, you need to start both the frontend and backend servers.

1. Start the frontend development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
2. Start the Flask backend server:

   ```bash
   npm run start-backend
   ```

#### Production Build

To build the application for production, follow these steps:

1. Build the frontend:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
2. Start the Flask backend server:

   ```bash
   npm run start-backend
   ```

```

### 5. Configuration

- **Backend Configuration:** No additional configuration is required for the backend. However, you can modify the Flask application logic in `backend/app.py` as needed.
- **Frontend Configuration:** Update the `proxy` field in `frontend/package.json` if the backend server is running on a different port.

### 6. Usage

1. Access the application in a web browser by visiting `http://localhost:3000`.
2. Upload an image using the provided interface.
3. Perform image processing tasks such as object detection, classification, and captioning.
4. View the processed image with annotations.

### 7. Contributing

Contributions to the project are welcome. To contribute, follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/fooBar`).
3. Make changes and commit them (`git commit -am 'Add some fooBar'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/fooBar`).
5. Create a new pull request.
